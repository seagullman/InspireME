# InspireME
This is an application that I am developing for learning purposes.

InspireME was an idea that I thought of after recieving daily emails from my mom containing a "quote of the day". I decided to start working on a mobile solution that would allow people to create an account and post an inspirational or motivational quote for others to see.

This app integrates with Firebase to hold user login data as well as all of the quotes or 'Posts'. When a user creates a new 'post' and submits it, it is immediately available for others to see, and will update in realtime if a user already has the app open. 




**This is still a work in progress. Functionality above has been implemented and is working, but still needs to be refined.**

**Not updated for Swift 3 yet**
